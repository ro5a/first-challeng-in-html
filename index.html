    <p>his study aims to access the quality of work-life and characteristics between medical representatives br
      and hospital pharmacists to understand the current QWL status among these health workers. This research was led with a cross-sectional design conducted with a survey using the work-related quality of life scale-2. There were 296 medical representatives and 344 hospital pharmacists participating in this study. The results showed that medical representatives had better QWL scores than hospital pharmacists. This study suggests that governments and the
      <br> international community should invest in workplace programs for pharmacists that improve their QWL.</p>
